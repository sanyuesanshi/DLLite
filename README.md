# DLLite

A simple and efficient framework in C++ to study deep learnning. support CPU/GPU based calculation.

Done:
1. support NN arch. can define the network topology easily 
2. use minst as an example, > 96% accurate with relu and 2 hidden layer.

ToDo:
1. Support e2e gpu based training/inferring. (now only support the perf critical operation)
2. Support batch normalization layer.
3. Support CNN.
4. add a cfg file to define the network topology.
